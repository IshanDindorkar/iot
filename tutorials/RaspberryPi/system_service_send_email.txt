1. Install msmtp on RaspberryPi using steps given on this page -
https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=244147

2. If page is gone, follow these commands
sudo apt-get install msmtp msmtp-mta
sudo nano /etc/msmtprc

# Generics
defaults
auth           on
tls            on
# following is different from ssmtp:
tls_trust_file /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt
# user specific log location, otherwise use /var/log/msmtp.log, however, 
# this will create an access violation if you are user pi, and have not changes the access rights
logfile        ~/.msmtp.log

# Gmail specifics
account        gmail
host           smtp.gmail.com
port           587

from          root@raspi-buster
user           your-gmail-accountname@gmail.com
password       your-gmail-account-password

# Default
account default : gmail

Now you can test if you are able to send email
echo 'your message' | msmtp destination-email-address@gmail.com

3. Create service to kickoff at startup
Edit this file ->>>

sudo nano /lib/systemd/system/send_startup_email.service

The contents should look like this -

[Unit]
Description=Report IP by Email
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=idle
ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 30
ExecStart=/home/pi/send_startup_email.sh

[Install]
WantedBy=network.target

Note: this line > ExecStartPre=/bin/sleep 30 is needed for networks to come up and running before searching for smtp host

4. Now enable the service using this command -
sudo systemctl enable send_startup_email.service 

To check status of the service -
sudo systemctl status send_startup_email.service 

5. Reboot RaspberryPi to check if email is triggered
sudo reboot
